High level description:

-- 1 Base station, N cubes

-- Communication Interface: 

-- Base station to cubes: Radio (915 MHz)

-- Cube to cube: NFMI

-- The cubes communicate with one another by sending the following information:

    -- Cube ID
    
    -- Face ID through which it transmits the signal

-- Each cube maintains a table that is updated once it gets packets from the neighboring cubes

-- Each entry contains ID of the neighboring node
   
    -- Face ID of the neighboring node
   
    -- Face ID of its own

-- The Base Station periodically sends ‚ÄòPOLL‚Äô packets to all the cubes in its communication range and in the same network

-- The cubes on receiving the POLL packets from the BSS, sends the following information to the base station:

    -- Table with cube ID and face ID as the entries
    
    -- Acceleration along three axes
    
    -- Battery information

-- From the accelerometer data that the BSS got from the cubes, it outputs the orientation of the cube

-- Void Loop():

    Wait for packets to be received
    
    Check if the packet is a POLL packet from base station
    
    Check if the packet is destined to itself
    
    If yes:
    
        Include its table in the outgoing packet
        
        Put its accelerometer data in the outgoing packet
        
        Enable NFMI
        
        Transmit proximity signal containing the information of BLOCK_ID and FACE_ID 
    
    Else:
     
        Set NFMI to receive mode
        
        Receive the packets from the neighboring cubes
        
        Update its table using the FACE_ID information using the neighbor (fillNeighbor function)



Sequence of events executed in cube ùëñ:

A. Initialize the radio and accelerometer. Set the input/output pins

B. Turn On the Blue LED after the required modules are initialized

C. Wait till it receives any POLL from the base station

D. When a cube ùëñ receives a ‚ÄòPoll‚Äô from the base station:

    1. Checks if the received poll is for itself
    
    2. If the poll is for itself:
    
          i. Sends a poll response to the base station with the following information:
          
                Own cube ID
                
                Destination (Base station ID)
                
                Flag indicating that it is a poll response 
                
                Table with the information received via all its NFMI coils
                
                Accelerometer readings along 3-axes
                
                Battery charge
                
                Time elapsed from the poll; time elapsed from the start of the cube
          
          ii. Put the NFMI interface in the transmit mode
          
          iii. Sends NFMI signals along all the 6 faces in a TDMA manner
    
    3. Else (poll is for some other cubes):
    
          i. Put the NFMI interfaces in receiving mode
          
          ii. Listens across all its 6 faces in a TDMA manner
          
          iii. If there is any signal received across any of its faces:
          
                Save the face id through which it received signal and the timestamp
                
                Update the table entry (Face ID of cube ùëñ, Neighboring cube ID, Neighboring cube‚Äôs face ID)
